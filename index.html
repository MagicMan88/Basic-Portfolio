                <p>A long long time ago there was a young (relatively speaking) marketing enthusiast named Stephen Green, he had recently graduated from Western Governors University
                with a B.S. in Marketing Management degree and was looking for his next quest. He had thrown around a few ideas, was he to go to graduate school for an MBA or an MSBA 
                as he had been working in Risk Operations and Data Analysis, or should he pursue his lifelong dream of attending Hogwarts and become learned in the magical arts? Alas,
                he decided that an MBA wasn't for him at this time and since he's a muggle and would not be admitted into Hogwarts, he decided to pursue his passion for marketing and technology and enroll in the Full-Stack Developer Coding Bootcamp at the University of Utah. The journey begins now, where will it take him. To be continued..
